       "'[\\'Baked plum, licorice and lavender aromas and flavors define this jammy wine, which takes on a sweetness of oak. Thick on the midpalate, it has substantial weight from the tannins and powerfully ripe fruit.\\'\\n \\'Pomegranate and light baking-spice aromas show on the mellow nose of this bottling. The palate is clean with fruit punch and spice-cake flavors wrapped in a fairly mellow texture.\\'\\n \\'Butter and vanilla notes dominate the jammy fruit flavors in this rich and seemingly sweet wine. It is medium bodied, lightly tannic and heavily influenced by oaky aromas and flavors, including baking spices and maple syrup.\\'\\n \"An aroma like toasted almonds and wood smoke meets spiced plum and red-cherry flavors in this medium-bodied wine. It\\'s an oaky version that maintains pretty good balance.\"\\n \\'Plum skin and pomegranate lead the nose while white pepper and raw oak take on an earthy edge. The soft-bodied palate is awash in silky tannins, with intense flavors of vanilla, oak and green tobacco leaf over black cherry and plum. There is a spicy kick on the finish, with more vanilla and baked black plum.\\'\\n \\'This is a big ripe red wine moderate in structure that offers fleshy mouthfuls of cola and black cherry.\\'\\n \\'This wine is a blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon and 38% Merlot, with the balance Malbec and Petit Verdot. Aromas of mushroom, dried herb, wet gravel, spice and cherry lead to ripe cherry and soy flavors. The palate brings a sense of elegance and appeal.\\'\\n \\'Honey-dipped pineapple and guava, with a touch of fig give this wine a fruity midpalate. This has a moderate structure and a lingering note of anise.\\'\\n \\'Thick and oaky, this estate wine evokes caramel and pineapple-upside-down cake‚Äîits texture lushly unctuous and rich.\\'\\n \\'With an ashy undercurrent of char and smoke, this wine offers medium-bodied layers of dried cherry and leather, finishing with a lasting note of black pepper.\\'\\n \\'Dusty with highlights of cedar and sage, this full-bodied wine presents as somewhat dull on the palate‚Äîa soft, rounded and approachable expression of jammy blueberry.\\'\\n \\'Yellow apple and sweet oak aromas make for a pleasant if not particularly complex aromatic entry to this bottling. Ripe apple and pear meet with sweet buttercream on the palate.\\'\\n \\'This is a full-bodied, boldly ripe Cabernet Sauvignon. Soft layers of dark cherry and plum are well integrated and contrasted against dusty crushed rock and toasted oak.\\'\\n \\'Aromas of ripe blueberry and blackberry mingle with vanilla and pumpkin spice on the nose. The fruit forward palate shows plum and cranberry backed by dried leaves, nutmeg and vanilla. The tannins are dusty yet structured, while the acidity is tied to the berry flavors and weaves in and out. It finishes with a tart berry flavor loaded with cracked pepper and earthy.\\'\\n \\'Brawny fruit is overwhelmed by smoke and charred oak in this thickly tannic wine that has a jammy core of blackberry and marshmallow flavor.\\'\\n \\'Pear, butter and vanilla aromas lead to a soft, rich texture and tasty fruit flavors. The wine is medium in weight, low in acidity and easy on the palate.\\'\\n \\'This is an easygoing, fruity wine that shows sweet-oak aromas, a soft texture and candy-like flavors of cherries and raspberries. The body is medium, tannins are light and it finishes with a sense of sweetness.\\'\\n \\'This has a wealth of cherry cola flavor that brushes up against varietal black currant and cedar. It takes on a lush brawny ripeness that overwhelms and opts for fruit flavor over structure.\\'\\n \\'Floral and quite cherry-berry in fruity flavor, this wine has mild structure and generous tannin, with a midpalate bursting in earthy oak.\\'\\n \\'Very extracted aromas of red currants and all spice show on the ripe nose of this bottling. Muddled plums and berries meet with spice cake on the rich palate.\\']'"
